# Assignment 1 - Write UP

## Description
This is the portion of the assignment that will be graded.  I will be looking at your other files, and specifically either `a1.py` or `a1_ai_problems.py`.  I will be looking to see that you completed the problems or used a generative AI to help you come up with and complete some challenge questions.  This document will help guide you through that process.

## Options for Assignment 1
- Complete the `a1.py` file completely and answer the reflection questions in this file.  Mr. Berg will be looking at both files.
- Complete the `python_with_generative_ai.md` and put your programming portions in `a1_ai_problems.py`.

Mr. Berg will look at all your files to determine what you have completed.  If there are any questions for this assignment, Mr. Berg will ask in class after he grades them.


## Reflection Questions

1. What is your initial thoughts about the python programming language?

I learned some python a few years ago but I had forgotten all of it by now, so initially I was not into to it and wished it was Java. However, now that I've done all of the a1 problems, I kind of like Python because it feels like a lot of things in it are intuitive or at least easy to figure out, since it gives you lists of functions and explains what each function does. With a language like Java, its more of a process to learn how to do different things.

2. Describe some similarities and differences that you found between python and other programming languages you have used in the past?

The only other programming language that I've used other than python is Java, and compared to that Python feels a lot more easygoing and almost carefree. You don't always have to think about things like variable types, and as long as you get the indentation right you don't need to wrry much. Last year in APCSA I got in the habit of worrying about indentation, so that meant I had to have both proper indentation and correct semicolons, whereas in Python you don't need to worry about semi colons at all. Also, its nice to not have to put curly brackets around the inside of functions, and whenever I forget to put a colon after something like a for loop it makes it very clear with a red squiggly line.

3. What are some things that you learned through this assignment?

I think the most important thing I learned in this assignment is what the heck is going on with this software. Code hs is a lot simpler than this and has a clear output space, so it was quite overwhelming initially when we started working on this software and I didn't understand anything about it. Something that actually delayed me from starting the assignment was that I didn't really get all of the stuff in the a1.py code and I was confused how we were going to complete and check all of those code segments in one program. The other important thing that I learned was how to do a lot of the thing that I can do in Java in Python. I could have done any of the a1 problems in Java, but learning how to do them in Python was necessary to prepare me for whatever we are doing next.
